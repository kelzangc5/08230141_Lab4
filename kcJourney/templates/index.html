        <h2>🌱 My Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Kelzang Choden</strong>, and this page reflects my path of growth, exploration, and discovery in the field of <strong>Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</strong>. Over time, I have developed not only technical skills but also confidence, curiosity, and a passion for continuous learning.</p>

        <h3>🚀 My Inspiration</h3>
        <p>My interest in ICT began when I realized how technology can transform the way we learn and teach. As an aspiring teacher, I wanted to understand how digital tools could make learning more engaging, interactive, and accessible. This motivation pushed me to explore programming, web design, and database management.</p>

        <h3>📘 My Milestones</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning Python and programming basics</li>
            <li>Understanding web development with HTML, CSS, and Django</li>
            <li>Developing personal projects to apply knowledge</li>
            <li>Collaborating in group projects for practical experience</li>
            <li>Exploring database management and data structures</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>💡 Projects That Shaped Me</h3>
        <p>One of my favorite projects was creating a <strong>Personal Learning Journey website</strong> using the Django framework. It helped me understand how back-end and front-end development connect.</p>
        <p>I also worked on a <strong>digital learning video project</strong> about the Internet, which allowed me to combine creativity with technical knowledge through scripting, editing, and sound design.</p>

        <h3>🌟 Skills I’ve Developed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Web design and development</li>
            <li>Python and Django framework</li>
            <li>Database management and SQL</li>
            <li>Problem-solving and logical thinking</li>
            <li>Teamwork and collaboration</li>
            <li>Communication and creativity in teaching</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🎯 My Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Master Django and full-stack web development</li>
            <li>Create interactive educational tools</li>
            <li>Integrate ICT effectively in classroom teaching</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🌈 My Vision</h3>
        <p>I believe technology is not just about coding, it is about connecting people, ideas, and knowledge. My journey in ICT continues with the hope of inspiring others to explore, learn, and grow in this ever-evolving digital world.</p>
